#Hello New Thing Added first time now through remote repo but not in working directory

# BestPractices

Used Angular framework and all its necessary terminologies required like Creating Components, PropertyBinding,Event Binding,Dependency Injection and Services,Http Response/Request,Directives,Models,CrossComponent Communication,String Interpolation etc.

Filtering data using  HttpParams and changing API query parameters dynamically based on filter buttons clicked and same can be reused again and again(click and unclick) without refereshing the page and filter the data based on currrent active filters.

Responsive UI in bootstrap 4 grid system handy with  mobiles,tablets and desktop.

Used Bootstrap Display Utilities to show and hide some tags and data  based on breakpoints.

All components styled and designed in CSS no bootstrap classes used for styling.

Clean Code with all the necessary imports and developed UI according to the requirements.

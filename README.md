# BestPractices

Used Angular framework and all its necessary terminologies required like Creating Components, PropertyBinding,Event Binding,Dependency Injection and Services,Http Response/Request,Directives,Models,CrossComponent Communication,String Interpolation etc.

Filtering data using  HttpParams and changing API query parameters dynamically based on filter buttons clicked and same can be reused again and again(click and unclick) without refereshing the page and filter the data based on currrent active filters.

Responsive UI in bootstrap 4 grid system handy with  mobiles,tablets and desktop.

Used Bootstrap Display Utilities to show and hide some tags and data  based on breakpoints.

All components styled and designed in CSS no bootstrap classes used for styling.

Clean Code with all the necessary imports and developed UI according to the requirements.

#Important Note

Please download bootstrap 4 into project structure or add it dynamically before using the source code to see the responsive behaviour of this app.

To add bootstrap dynamically in project :-

Copy-paste the below stylesheet <link> into your <head> before all other stylesheets to load CSS in index.html.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-JcKb8q3iqJ61gNV9KGb8thSsNjpSL0n8PARn9HuZOnIxN0hoP+VmmDGMN5t9UJ0Z" crossorigin="anonymous">

and place the following <script> near the end of your pages, right before the closing </body> tag in index.html

<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-DfXdz2htPH0lsSSs5nCTpuj/zy4C+OGpamoFVy38MVBnE+IbbVYUew+OrCXaRkfj" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
